reviewbody - "Nearing brown in color  this blend of 60% Viognier and 40% Chardonnay is reminiscent of a Old Fashioned cocktail  with orange rind and bourbon notes as well as walnut oil and quinine aromas. A strong hazelnut-oil character shows on the rougher palate  which is thick and oily with dried apricot and more orange peel."

It's not tricked up with oak  but the sharp young berry flavors evolve in the mouth and bring on clove  wintergreen and mint  which resonate through a lingering finish.
